Welcome to the super duper funicular story of JRAD the king of POP. In the kingdom of POP all was calm, JRAD was doing his usual dance around town. When all of a sudden the ground was shaking with a somewhat country vibe and all was changed forever.....

A huge stage then appeared and three men in black hoodies and baggy jeans was on it. Jard looked over and felt like they were looking at him too.
They suddenly waved to Jard after a quick discussion. Jard was very confused but his curiosity pushed him move forward.

The three men gave jared the sword of glory and told him that he was the chosen one, chosen to slay the king of the demons. JRAD accepted his mission
and started preparing for him long journey towards the castle of demons.

With the sword of glory in hand, JRAD stood at the castle doors, ready for anything.....
